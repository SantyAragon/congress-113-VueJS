            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society, transparency is
                government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens hold
                their
                public
                officials accountable. Here at Data Insight Group we believe that government should be transparent.</p>
            <p>Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business and spend
                taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows good and just
                governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their
                Government is doing.</p>
            <p>We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's
                effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, and
                public
                officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to
                become
                actively engaged in American government.</p>
            <p>Data Insight Group works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We
                solicit
                public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

            <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>
            <p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion
                dates
                back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on absolutist
                doctrine
                of
                state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative instruments
                to
                this
                end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland as a
                Swedish-governed
                territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766).
                This
                approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the
                eighteenth-century public sphere.</p>

                    <p>Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789),
                        freedom of the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary
                        accounting
                        and freedom of the press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts
                        by
                        Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a
                        number of
                        eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the
                        latter.
                    </p>

                    <p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice
                        and
                        is often linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian
                        countries
                        claim to have adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins
                        of
                        its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption
                        of
                        openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official
                        Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).</p>

                    <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
                        Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
